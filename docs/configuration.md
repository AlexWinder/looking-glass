# Looking Glass: Configuration Options

## Format

The *config.php* file is a piece of regular PHP source code. This means you
need to follow the rules or the interface will work.

You can mostly get by copying the example lines, just make sure all your
strings are quoted and your statements end in a semicolon (;).

All the default values for the configuration are defined in the
*includes/config.defaults.php* file. This file *must* not be edited. The
directives set in *config.php* will automatically override the default ones.

## Directives

These are the available configuration options. They can be set in *config.php*.
